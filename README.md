# Computer-Vision-Image-Basics-with-OpenCV

This one-hour project-based course on Coursera provides a concise introduction to computer vision using OpenCV and Python in Jupyter Notebook.

# Objectives
In this course, you will:

1. Understand important considerations when working with OpenCV, including image formats, data types, and coordinate systems.
2. Learn to draw on images using code, enabling annotation and highlighting of specific regions or objects.
3. Develop the ability to draw on images interactively using the mouse, allowing manual annotation and precise shape or region marking.

# Project Structure
The hands on project on Computer Vision - Image Basics with OpenCV and Python is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction

Task 2: How to open an Image with Matplotlib

Task 3: Get familiar with RGB channels

Task 4: Differences between Matplotlib and OpenCV

Task 5: Resize & Flip an Image

Task 6: Draw Shapes on an Image (Part 1)

Task 7: Draw Shapes on an Image (Part 2)

Task 8: Draw with the Mouse

Task 9: Event Choices for the Mouse

Task 10: Mouse Functionality

__By the end of this course, you will be able to work with OpenCV on Images.__
